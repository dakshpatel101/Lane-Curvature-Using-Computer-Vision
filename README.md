# Lane-Curvature-Using-Computer-Vision

The paper addresses the limitations and comparisons of existing lane detection methods, which predominantly rely on either segmentation-based or point detection-based techniques. 
Previous lane detection methods typically rely on expensive sensors such as LIDAR. 
These methods often require complex post-processing, such as Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) or heuristic anchors, and struggle with real-time performance. 
This work aims to develop a lane detection method that leverages parametric BÃ©zier curves, which are easier to optimize, computationally efficient, and provide a natural representation of lane lines. 
This approach aims to improve accuracy and speed while reducing the complexity and post-processing requirements
